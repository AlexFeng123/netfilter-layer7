v1.2 - Bug fix release:

- Fixed another (smaller, but significant) memory leak in 2.6 kernel. 
The fix is a bit of a hack and I'd like to fix it in a more satisfying
way later.

- Fixed compilation of 2.4 kernel on RH9 and other systems by adding
another #include to ipt_layer7.c

No change to iptables.


v1.1 - Added patch for Linux 2.6.11.X.  No real changes.


v1.0.1 - Bug fix release:

- Fixed memory leak in kernel.  

- Fixed iptables crash on AMD64. 

- Fixed kernel compilation problem on AMD64.

This release does not yet work with Linux 2.6.11.X.  Wait for v1.1 if
you need that.  (Should be soon.)


v1.0 - No changes to 2.4 version or iptables.  Shuffled around a bit of code
in the 2.6 version so that it could patch cleanly to both 2.6.9 and 
2.6.10.  Included the previous version of 2.6 patch so that people using 
2.6.0-2.6.8 don't have to get an older package.


v1.0-rc1 - No changes to the 2.4 version or iptables.  For 2.6:

- Connections that have no match and are no longer being tested are now
marked "unknown". 

- Now uses (and depends on) "Connection tracking flow accounting"
(CONFIG_IP_NF_CT_ACCT). 

- Skbuffs are now linearized and error messages are net_ratelimited.


v0.9.1 - Changes to ipt_helper.c that aren't part of l7-filter had crept
into the 2.6 patch of v0.9.0.  They are now removed.  No other changes.


v0.9.0 - 2.4 version now should compile correctly if l7-filter is
built-in. Fixed a significant bug which caused some patterns not to work
(tolower was munging 'upper ascii' characters).  No change to iptables.


v0.8.2 - Iptables now uses modular man pages (as of v1.2.10).  The iptables
patch now conforms to this new format.  No change to kernel.


v0.8.1 - Made code slightly more paranoid about running out of memory.  No 
change to iptables.


v0.8 - Small improvements to locking code.  All kmallocs should be
checked now. Converted the regexp code into this century's C syntax. 
Added a patch for Linux 2.4.  No change to iptables.


v0.7 - Improvements to locking code.  No change to iptables.


v0.6.1 - Fixed places where iptables used --l7-proto instead of --l7proto.
No change to kernel.


v0.6 - Significant kernel code cleanup.  Attempted to make code SMP safe with
spin_lock() and GFP_ATOMIC.  No change to iptables code.


v0.5 - Initial release in this format.
