In this directory you will find:

- a patch for Linux 2.6 called "kernel-2.6-layer7-1.0.1.patch"

This patch is against 2.6.10 and also works with 2.6.9.  It will not
work with versions before 2.6.9 or after 2.6.11.

- a patch for Linux 2.6 called "for_older_kernels/kernel-2.6-layer7-0.9.1.patch"

This patch works for kernels 2.6.0-2.6.8. It is lacking the "unknown"
match feature and some other improvements (see CHANGELOG).

- a patch for Linux 2.4 called "for_older_kernels/kernel-2.4-layer7-0.9.1.patch"

This patch is against 2.4.26 but will probably work with any 2.4.X
kernel. It is lacking the "unknown" match feature and some other
improvements (see CHANGELOG).

- a patch for iptables (independent of kernel version) called
"iptables-layer7-1.0.1.patch"

This patch is against 1.3.0, but should work with any reasonably modern
version of iptables.
