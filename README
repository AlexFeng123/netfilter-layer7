Here you will find:

- a patch for Linux 2.4.x
- a patch for Linux 2.6.x 
- a patch for iptables (independent of the kernel version)

The 2.4 patch is against 2.4.26 and the 2.6 patch is against 2.6.6, but
they probably work with any kernel of the appropriate series.

The iptables patch is against 1.2.11, but should work with any
reasonably modern version of iptables.
