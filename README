Here you will find:

- a patch for Linux 2.4.x
- a patch for Linux 2.6.x 
- a patch for iptables (independent of the kernel version)

The 2.4 patch is against 2.4.26 and the 2.6 patch is against 2.6.7, but
they probably work with any kernel of the appropriate series.

The iptables patch is against 1.2.11, but should work with any
reasonably modern version of iptables.  Note that iptables will not
compile against Linux 2.6.7 (this is NOT a l7-filter bug), but it will
still work if you compile it against another version.
