***** kernel patches *****

- a patch for Linux 2.6 called "kernel-2.6.13-2.6.14-layer7-2.0.patch"

This patch is against 2.6.14 and will also work with 2.6.13. It won't
work with earlier kernels. Hopefully, it works with future ones (but
this isn't tested, obviously). For older 2.6 kernels, see the
"for_older_kernels" directory. Here you will find files named like this:
 
"kernel-[kernel version range]-layer7-[l7-filter-version].patch".

Use the one that matches your kernel version.  If the l7-filter version
is not the latest, then it may be missing some newer features.  See CHANGELOG.

- a patch for Linux 2.4 called "kernel-2.4-layer7-2.0.patch"

This patch is against 2.4.31.  As far as we know, it works with all 2.4
versions, but we have not tested them all.  It is highly likely that it
will work with all future 2.4 versions.

***** iptables patch *****

- a patch for iptables (independent of kernel version) called
"iptables-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch"

This patch is against 1.3.0, but should work with any reasonably modern
version of iptables.
