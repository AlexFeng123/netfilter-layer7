***** kernel patches *****

- kernel-2.6.25-layer7-2.19.patch

  This patch is against 2.6.25. It will not work with 2.6.24.x or earlier.
  Hopefully, it works with future kernel versions (obviously we don't know yet).
  This package will NOT be updated just because a new kernel is released.
  Check http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/kernelcompat for up-to-date 
  compatibility information.

- kernel-2.4-layer7-2.19.patch

  This patch is against 2.4.31. It is extremely likely that it will work with
  all future 2.4 versions.  If you have some bizzare reason to use an older
  2.4 kernel, check http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/kernelcompat

- for_older_kernels/

  Here you will find files named
  "kernel-[kernel version range]-layer7-[l7-filter-version].patch".

  Use the one that matches your kernel version. If the l7-filter version
  is not the latest, then it may be missing some newer features. See CHANGELOG.

***** iptables patches *****

- iptables-1.3-for-kernel-pre2.6.20-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch

  Use this patch if you are compiling iptables 1.3.x against Linux 2.6.19.x or
  earlier, including 2.4.x.

- iptables-1.3-for-kernel-2.6.20forward-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch

  Use this patch if you are compiling iptables 1.3.x against Linux 2.6.20 or
  later.

- iptables-1.4-for-kernel-2.6.20forward-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch

  Use this patch if you are compiling iptables 1.4.0 against Linux 2.6.20 or
  later.

- iptables-1.4.1.1-for-kernel-2.6.20forward-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch

  Use this patch if you are compiling iptables 1.4.1.1 or later against Linux
  2.6.20 or later.

- If you need to compile iptables 1.4.x against Linux 2.6.19.x or earlier, 
  let us know.

You do NOT need to recompile iptables if you change your running kernel 
version across the 2.6.20 boundary and you already have a working iptables.

However, you DO need to recompile iptables if you switch from a kernel 
patched with l7-filter <= v2.10 to one patched with l7-filter >= v2.11.
