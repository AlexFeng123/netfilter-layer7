***** kernel patches *****

- a patch for Linux 2.6 called "kernel-2.6.22-layer7-2.14.patch"

  This patch is against 2.6.22-rc7. It will not work with Linux 2.6.21 or
  earlier. Hopefully, it works with future kernel versions (obviously we don't
  know yet). For older 2.6 kernels, see the "for_older_kernels" directory.
  Here you will find files named like this:
 
  "kernel-[kernel version range]-layer7-[l7-filter-version].patch".

  Use the one that matches your kernel version. If the l7-filter version
  is not the latest, then it may be missing some newer features. See CHANGELOG.

- a patch for Linux 2.4 called "kernel-2.4-layer7-2.14.patch"

  This patch is against 2.4.31. As far as we know, it works with all 2.4
  versions, but we have not tested them all. It is extremely likely that it
  will work with all future 2.4 versions.

***** iptables patches *****

- a patch for iptables called
  "iptables-for-kernel-pre2.6.20-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch"

  Use this patch if you are compiling against Linux 2.6.19.x or earlier, 
  including 2.4.x.   You do *not* need to recompile if your kernel version
  later changes to 2.6.20 or later and you already have a working iptables.

- a patch for iptables called
  "iptables-for-kernel-2.6.20forward-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch"

  Use this patch if you are compiling against Linux 2.6.20 or later.
  You do *not* need to recompile if you downgrade your kernel to 2.6.19.x
  or earlier and you already have a working iptables.

  These patches are against iptables 1.3.8, but they only add files (they
  don't change any existing ones) and so should work with any reasonably
  modern version of iptables and should continue to work for all future
  versions unless major changes are made to the iptables architecture.
