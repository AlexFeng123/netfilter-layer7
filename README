***** kernel patches *****

- a patch for Linux 2.6 called "kernel-2.6.13-2.6.16-layer7-2.2.patch"

  This patch is against 2.6.16.14.  It also works with versions back as far
  as 2.6.13, but won't work with earlier kernels. Hopefully, it works with 
  future ones (obviously we don't know yet). For older 2.6 kernels, see the
  "for_older_kernels" directory. Here you will find files named like this:
 
  "kernel-[kernel version range]-layer7-[l7-filter-version].patch".

  Use the one that matches your kernel version.  If the l7-filter version
  is not the latest, then it may be missing some newer features.  See CHANGELOG.

- a patch for Linux 2.4 called "kernel-2.4-layer7-2.2.patch"

  This patch is against 2.4.31.  As far as we know, it works with all 2.4
  versions, but we have not tested them all.  It is extremely likely that it
  will work with all future 2.4 versions.

***** iptables patch *****

- a patch for iptables (independent of kernel version) called
"iptables-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch"

  This patch is against 1.3.3, but it only adds files (it does not change
  any existing ones) and so should work with any reasonably modern version
  of iptables and should continue to work for all future versions unless
  major changes are made to the iptables architecture.
