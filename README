In this directory you will find:

- a patch for Linux 2.6 called "kernel-2.6.11-layer7-1.1.patch"

This patch is against 2.6.11.  It won't work with earlier kernels.  It may
work with later ones.


- a directory called "for_older_kernels/"

This contains patches for older kernels.  The file names have the format:
"kernel-[kernel version range]-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch".

Use the one that matches your kernel version.  If the l7-filter version is
not the latest, then it may be missing some newer features.  See CHANGELOG.


- a patch for iptables (independent of kernel version) called
"iptables-layer7-[l7-filter version].patch"

This patch is against 1.3.0, but should work with any reasonably modern
version of iptables.
