Here you will find:

- a patch for Linux 2.6.x 
- a patch for Linux 2.4.x 
- a patch for iptables (independent of the kernel version)

The 2.6 patch is against 2.6.10.  It will not work with versions before 2.6.9.
If you need l7-filter for Linux 2.6.0-2.6.8, get l7-filter version 0.9.1.

The 2.4 patch is against 2.4.26 but will probably work with any 2.4.X kernel.
It has slightly fewer features than the 2.6 version, notably lacking the 
"unknown" match.  (This is why it is marked as version 0.9.1.)

The iptables patch is against 1.2.11, but should work with any reasonably 
modern version of iptables.
